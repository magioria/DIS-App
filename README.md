# DIS-App 🏀

Welcome to the **Defensive Impact Score (DIS)**!  
DIS is my own custom stat that brings a new way to look at NBA defense, going beyond the box score to capture how much impact players (and teams) really have on that end of the floor.  

The app itself is the way I decided to share it. Built with **Python + Streamlit**, this app makes it easy to explore, compare, and visualize defensive value in a fun and interactive way.

## ✨ What You Can Do
- **Player Profiles** → Check a player’s DIS history and compare them with others.  
- **Team Profiles** → See how whole teams perform, with weighted minutes and rankings.  
- **Leaderboards** → Browse player and team leaderboards for every season.  
- **Filters** → Apply minutes or games-played filters so only serious contributors show up.

## 🔮 What’s Coming Next
- Add **correlation tools** for deeper analysis.  
- Add a **forecasting mode** to predict defensive trends.

## 🙌 Why I Built This
Defense is the hardest part of basketball to measure. Box score stats don’t tell the full story, so I turned to **advanced stats, z-scores and custom-built defensive models** to build something that captures value more realistically.  

The goal: make defense measurable, comparable, and fun to explore.
