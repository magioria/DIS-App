# DIS-App 🏀

Welcome to the **Defensive Impact Score (DIS)** project!  
This app brings a new way to look at NBA defense — a stat that goes beyond the box score to capture how much impact players (and teams) really have on that end of the floor.  

Built with **Python + Streamlit**, this app makes it easy to explore, compare, and visualize defensive value in a fun and interactive way.

## ✨ What You Can Do
- 👤 **Player Profiles** → Check a player’s DIS history and compare them with others.  
- 🏟 **Team Profiles** → See how whole teams perform, with weighted minutes and rankings.  
- 📊 **Leaderboards** → Browse player and team leaderboards for every season.  
- 🎛 **Filters** → Apply minutes or games-played filters so only serious contributors show up.

## 🔮 What’s Coming Next
- Bring back **correlation tools** for deeper analysis.  
- Add a **forecasting mode** to predict defensive trends.  
- More advanced **lineup and role-based metrics**.

## 🙌 Why I Built This
Defense is the hardest part of basketball to measure. Box score stats don’t tell the full story — so I turned to **advanced stats, z-scores, weighted minutes, and custom-built defensive models** to build something that captures value more realistically.  

The goal: make defense measurable, comparable, and fun to explore.
